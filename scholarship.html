        DECA members will apply for scholarships through the Student Member Portal. Once in the portal, click "Apply for Scholarships," complete your profile and click “Submit” at the bottom. After submitting your profile, the scholarship applications will populate with any scholarships for which you meet the criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scholarship applications may be saved and finished later, providing that your student profile is submitted. The scholarship program will time out after 20 minutes of non-usage.
